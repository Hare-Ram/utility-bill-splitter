# utility-bill-splitter
Split common utility bill in cases with unit based differential tariff and where data for consumption for individual users is partially available.

## Example
Considering a scenario where some people are sharing an apartment and few of them are using heavy appliances, e.g. AC. Now if they want to divide common utility bill in a fair way, they would want to know how much units appliances(assuming smart applliances) consume for each user, calculate energy price for appliances, then get energy bill for common utilities, which can be divided equall among all users. However for appliances, users pay as per consumption.
